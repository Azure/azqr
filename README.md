# Azure Quick Review

[![Open in vscode.dev](https://img.shields.io/badge/Open%20in-vscode.dev-blue)](https://vscode.dev/github/Azure/azqr)

**Azure Quick Review (azqr)** is a command-line interface (CLI) tool specifically designed to analyze Azure resources and identify whether they comply with Azure's best practices and recommendations. Its primary purpose is to provide users with a detailed overview of their Azure resources, enabling them to easily identify any non-compliant configurations or potential areas for improvement.

## Scan Results

The output generated by **Azure Quick Review (azqr)** is presented by default in four `csv` files:

* **azqr-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS.services.csv:** This file contains the details of the Azure services scanned by the tool, including:
    * Subscription: The unique identifier for the Azure subscription under which the resource is deployed.
    * Resource Group: The resource group where the resource is deployed.
    * Location: The geographical region where the resource is deployed.
    * Type: The specific type or category of the Azure resource.
    * Service Name: The name assigned to the service, providing a human-readable identifier for easy reference and management.
    * Compliant: A Boolean value indicating whether the service is compliant with Azure's best practices and recommendations.
    * Impact: The potential impact of non-compliance on the service.
    * Category: The category or type of recommendation.
    * Recommendation: The specific recommendation or best practice.
    * Result: The result or value resulting from the evaluation of the recommendation (i.e. Service SLA or SKU). 
    * Learn: A link to additional information or documentation related to the recommendation.
* **azqr-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS.defender.csv:**
    * Subscription: The unique identifier for the Azure subscription under which the resource is deployed.
    * Name: Microsoft Defender for Cloud plan name.
    * Tier: The tier of the plan.
    * Deprecated: a Boolean value indicating whether the plan is deprecated.
* **azqr-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS.advisor.csv:**
    * Subscription: The unique identifier for the Azure subscription under which the resource is deployed.
    * Name: The name of the resource identified by Advisor.
    * Type: The resource type of the resource identified by Advisor.
    * Category: The category of the recommendation.
    * Description: The description of the recommendation.
    * PotentialBenefits: The potential benefits of the recommendation.
    * Risk: Risk related to the recommendation.
    * LearnMoreLink: A link to additional information or documentation related to the recommendation.
* **azqr-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS.costs.csv:**
    * From: the start date of the cost analysis period.
    * To: the end date of the cost analysis period.
    * Subscription: The unique identifier for the Azure subscription under which the resource is deployed.
    * ServiceName: The type of the Azure service for which the cost is calculated.
    * Value: The cost value associated with the service.
    * Currency: The currency in which the cost is calculated.

> By default, Azure Quick Review (azqr) masks the Subscription Ids in the spreadsheet, ensuring that they are not directly visible in the output. This helps protect sensitive information and maintain data privacy and security. To view the Subscription Ids, you can use the `--mask=false` flag when running the tool.

> Azure Quick Review can also generate an Excel file with the same information as the CSV files. To generate the Excel file, you can use the `--excel` (or `-x`) flag when running the tool.

> A Power BI template is also available to help you visualize the results generated by Azure Quick Review. You can create the template running Azure Quick Review with the `pbi` command.

# Issue Triage Agent

List open issues in ${{ github.repository }} that have no labels. For each unlabeled issue, analyze the title and body, then add one of the allowed labels: `bug`, `feature`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, `question`, `help-wanted`, or `good-first-issue`. 

Skip issues that:
- Already have any of these labels
- Have been assigned to any user (especially non-bot users)

After adding the label to an issue, mention the issue author in a comment using this format (follow shared/reporting.md guidelines):

**Comment Template**:
```markdown
### 🏷️ Issue Triaged

Hi @{author}! I've categorized this issue as **{label_name}** based on the following analysis:

**Reasoning**: {brief_explanation_of_why_this_label}

<details>
<summary><b>View Triage Details</b></summary>

#### Analysis
- **Keywords detected**: {list_of_keywords_that_matched}
- **Issue type indicators**: {what_made_this_fit_the_category}
- **Confidence**: {High/Medium/Low}

#### Recommended Next Steps
- {context_specific_suggestion_1}
- {context_specific_suggestion_2}

</details>

**References**: [Triage run §{run_id}](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/actions/runs/{run_id})
```

**Key formatting requirements**:
- Use h3 (###) for the main heading
- Keep reasoning visible for quick understanding
- Wrap detailed analysis in `<details>` tags
- Include workflow run reference
- Keep total comment concise (collapsed details prevent noise)

## Batch Comment Optimization

For efficiency, if multiple issues are triaged in a single run:
1. Add individual labels to each issue
2. Add a brief comment to each issue (using the template above)
3. Optionally: Create a discussion summarizing all triage actions for that run

This provides both per-issue context and batch visibility.

**Azure Quick Review (azqr)** is a command-line interface (CLI) tool specifically designed to analyze Azure resources and identify whether they comply with Azure's best practices and recommendations. Its primary purpose is to provide users with a detailed overview of their Azure resources, enabling them to easily identify any non-compliant configurations or potential areas for improvement.

## Scan Results

The output generated by **Azure Quick Review (azqr)** is presented in the form of an Excel file, which consists of several sheets including **Overview**, **Recommendations**, **Services**, **Defender**, **Advisor** and **Costs**. Additionally, when running the tool on a Windows system, it also generates a Power BI Desktop Template for further analysis and visualization of the Azure resource data.

The **Overview** sheet provides a summary of the Azure resources scanned by the tool, including the following information:

* **SubscriptionID**: This is the unique identifier for the Azure subscription under which the resource is deployed.
* **ResourceGroup**: The resource group where the resource is deployed.
* **Location**: The geographical region where the resource is deployed.
* **Type**: The specific type or category of the Azure resource.
* **Name**: The name assigned to the resource, providing a human-readable identifier for easy reference and management.
* **SKU**: The SKU represents the specific variant or configuration of the Azure resource. It defines the characteristics and capabilities of the resource.
* **SLA**: The Service Level Agreement (SLA) represents the agreed-upon performance and availability guarantees for the Azure service based on its current configuration.
* **AZ**: A Boolean value indicating whether the service is "Availability Zone aware." Availability Zones are physically separate datacenters within an Azure region, providing increased resiliency and fault tolerance for critical services.
* **PVT**: A Boolean value indicating whether the service has a private IP address. Private IP addresses are used for internal communication within Azure Virtual Networks.
* **DS**: A Boolean value indicating whether diagnostic settings are enabled for the service. Diagnostic settings allow you to collect logs, metrics, and other monitoring data for Azure resources.
* **CAF**: A Boolean value indicating whether the service is compliant with the [Cloud Adoption Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/resource-abbreviations) (CAF) naming convention. The CAF provides best practices and guidance for organizations adopting Azure.

> By default, Azure Quick Review (azqr) masks the Subscription Ids in the spreadsheet, ensuring that they are not directly visible in the output. This helps protect sensitive information and maintain data privacy and security. To view the Subscription Ids, you can use the `--mask=false` flag when running the tool.

To learn more about the **Recommendations**, **Services**, **Defender**, **Advisor** and **Costs** sheets, check the [Scan Results](https://azure.github.io/azqr/results) documentation.

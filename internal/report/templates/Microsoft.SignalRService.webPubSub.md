### Azure Web PubSub

Zone redundancy is a Premium tier feature. It is implicitly enabled when you create or upgrade to a Premium tier resource. Standard tier resources can be upgraded to Premium tier without downtime.

Azure Web PubSub Service uses availability zones in a zone-redundant manner. Zone redundancy means the service isn't constrained to run in a specific zone. Instead, total service is evenly distributed across multiple zones in a region. Zone redundancy reduces the potential for data loss and service interruption if one of the zones fails.
